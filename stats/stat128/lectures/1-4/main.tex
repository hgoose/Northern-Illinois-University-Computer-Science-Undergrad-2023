    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \textbf{\textit{\underline{Objectives for this section.}}}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Define Statistics and Statistical Thinking
        \item Explain the Process of Statistics
        \item Distinguish between Qualitative and Quantitative Variables
        \item Distinguish Between Discrete and Continuous Variables.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{\textit{\underline{Define Statistics and Statistical Thinking:}}}
    \bigbreak \noindent
        Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, summarizing, and analyzing information to draw conclusions or answer questions. In addition, statistics is about providing a measure of confidence in any conculsions.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \textbf{Note:} We must report a measure of our confidence in our results because we do not have 100\% certainty our answers are correct.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        The information referred to in the definition above is \textit{data}. \textbf{Data} are a "fact or proposition used to draw a conclusion or make a decision." Data describes characteristics of an individual.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        One crucial thing to understand about \textbf{data}, is that is \textbf{varies}. One thing that makes an interesting study is the fact that the data within the study varies. A study about number of hearts a human has is not only uninteresting but not worth doing. This is because the data does not vary.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \textbf{Two Major Goals:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Describe Variablitiy.
            \item Understand sources of Variablitiy.
        \end{enumerate}
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        In Statistics, the same approach to solving a problem can still lead to different results. This does not happen in a math class.

        \textbf{\textit{\underline{Explain the Process of Statistics.}}}
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        First lets define some vocabulary:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Population:} The entire group to be studied is called the population.
            \item \textbf{Sample:} In statistics, it is often impractical or impossible to get access to the entire \textbf{population}, which is why we only look at a \textbf{sample.} A sample is a \textbf{subset} of the population being studied.
            \item \textbf{Individual:} An individual is a person or object that is a member of the population being studied.
            \item \textbf{Statistic:} A statistic is a numerical summary of a sample.
            \item \textbf{Descriptive Statistics:} Descriptive statistics consist of organizing and summarizing data. Descriptive statistics describe data through numerical summaries, tables, and graphs.
            \item \textbf{Inferential Statistics:} inferential Statistics uses methods that take a result from a sample, extend it to the population, and measure the reliability of the result.
            \item \textbf{Parameter:} A parameter is a numerical summary of a population.
        \end{itemize}

        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \textbf{The process of statistics:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Identify the problem to be solved. It is important to clearly lay out the questions that the researcher wants answered, along with cleary specifying which populution the study applies.
            \item Collect the data.
            \item Describe the data.
            \item Preform inference.
        \end{enumerate}

        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \begin{mdframed}
          \textbf{Example: The AP - National Constitution Center conducted a national poll to learn how adult Americans feel existing gun-control laws infringe on the second amendment to the U.S Constitution}
          \bigbreak \noindent 
          \textbf{The Following statistical process allowed the researchers to conduct their study.}
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item \textbf{Identify the research objective.}: The researchers wished to determine the percentage of adult Americans who believe gun-control laws infringe on the public's right to bear arms.
            \item \textbf{Collect the information needed to answer the question posed in (1).}: It is unreasonable to expect to survey the more than 200 million adult Americans to detrmine how they feel about gun-control laws. So the researchers surveyed a sample of 1007 adult Americans. Of those surveyed, 514 stated they believe existing gun-control laws infringe on the public's right to bear arms.
            \item \textbf{Describe the data.}: Of the 1007 induviduals in the survey, 51\% believe existing gun-control laws infring on the public's right to bear arms. This is a descriptive statistic, because its value is determined from a sample.
            \item \textbf{Preform inference.}: The reasearchers at the AP - National Constitution Center wanted to extend the results of the survey to \textbf{all} adult Americans. When generalizing results from a sample to a population, the results are \textbf{uncertain}. To account for this uncertainty, researchers reported a 3\% \textit{margin of error.} This means that the researchers feel fairly certain (in fact, 95\% certain) that the percentage of \textit{all} adult Americans who believe existing gun-control laws infringe on the public's right to bear arms is somewhere between 48\% and 54\%

          \end{enumerate}

        \bigbreak \noindent \bigbreak \noindent 
        \textbf{\textit{\underline{Distinguish between Qualitative and Quantitative Variables}}}
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        First let's define some vocab:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Variables:} The characteristics of the induviduals in a study. Variables vary, which means they can take on different values.
            \item \textbf{Constants:} Variables that do not vary. Inferential statistics is not necessary with constants.
        \end{itemize}
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        One goal of research is to learn the causes of variablitiy.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        Variables can be classified into two groups: qualitative and quantitative.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Qualitative, or categorical variables} allow for the classification of individuals base on some attribute or characteristic.
            \item \textbf{Quantitative variables} provide numerical measures of induviduals. The values of a quantitative variable can be added or subtracted and provide meaningful results.
        \end{itemize}
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \begin{mdframed}
          \textbf{Example: Determine whether the following variables are qualitative or quantitative.}
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.)]
              \item \textbf{Gender.}: Qualitative
              \item \textbf{Temeperature.}: Quantitative
              \item \textbf{Number of days during the past week that a college student studied.}: Quantitative
              \item \textbf{Zip Code.} Qualitative
          \end{enumerate}
          \textbf{Caution:} A numeric value does not automatically suggest a variable is quantitative.
        \end{mdframed}

        \bigbreak \noindent 
        \textbf{\textit{\underline{Distinguish between Discrete and Continuous Variables.}}}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A \textbf{discrete variable} is a quantitative variable that has either a finite number of possible values or a countable number of possible values. A discrete variable cannot take on every possible value between any two possible values.
            \item A \textbf{continuous variable} is a quantitative variable that has an infinite number of possible values that are not countable. A continuous variable may take on every possible value between any two values. Continuous variables typically result from measurement. Continuous variables are often rounded. If a certain make of car gets 24 miles per gallon (mpg) of gasoline, its miles per gallon must be greater than or equal to 23.5 and less than 24.5, or $23.5 \leq mpg \leq 24.5$
        \end{itemize}

        \bigbreak \noindent 
        This Figure illustrates the relationship among qualitative, quantitative, discrete, and continuous variables.

        \begin{mdframed}
          \textbf{Example: Distinguish whether the quantitative variables are discrete or continuous.}
          \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.)]
            \item \textbf{The number of heads obtained after flipping a coin five times.}: Discrete
            \item \textbf{The number of cars that arrive at a McDonald's drive through between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM}: Discrete
            \item \textbf{The Distance a 2011 Toyota Prius can travel in city driving conditions with a full tank of gas.}: Continuous
