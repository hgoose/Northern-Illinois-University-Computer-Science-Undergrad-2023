    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Understand Random Processes and the Law of Large Numbers}
        \item \textbf{Apply the Rules of Probabilities}
        \item \textbf{Compute and Interpret Probabilities Using the Empirical Method}
        \item \textbf{Compute and Interpret Probabilities Using the Classical Method}
        \item \textbf{Recognize and Interpret Subjective Probabilities}
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Vocab:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Probability:} Is the measure of the likelihood of a random phenomenon or chance behavior occurring. It deals with experiments that yield random short-term results or outcomes yet reveal long-term predictability. The long-term proportion in which a certain outcome is observed is the probability of that outcome. 
        \item \textbf{Outcomes:} Short term results
        \item \textbf{The Law of Large Numbers:} As the number of repetitions of a probability experiment increases, the proportion with which a certain outcome is observed gets closer to the probability of the outcome.
        \item \textbf{an experiment} is any process with uncertain results that can be repeated.
        \item \textbf{The sample space, $S$,} of a probability experiment is the collection of all possible outcomes for that experiment.
        \item \textbf{An event} is any collection of outcomes from a probability experiment. An event consists of one or more outcomes. We denote events with one outcome, sometimes called simple events, as $e_{i}$. In general, events are denoted using capital letters such as $ E$.
        \item \textbf{A probability model} lists the possible outcomes of a probability experiment and each outcome's probability. A probability model must satisfy Rules 1 and 2 of the rules of probabilities.
        \item  \textbf{An unusual event} is an event that has a low probability of occurring.
        \item An experiment has \textbf{equally likely outcomes} when each outcome has the same probability of occurring. 
        \item A \textbf{subjective probability} is a probability that is determined based on personal judgment.
