    \subsection{Parametric Equations}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    In the two-dimensional coordinate system, parametric equations are useful for describing curves that are not necessarily functions. The parameter is an independent variable that both \( x \) and \( y \) depend on, and as the parameter increases, the values of \( x \) and \( y \) trace out a path along a plane curve. For example, if the parameter is \( t \) (a common choice), then \( t \) might represent time. Then \( x \) and \( y \) are defined as functions of time, and \( (x(t), y(t)) \) can describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a curved path.
    \bigbreak \noindent

        Consider the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Our year lasts approximately 365.25 days, but for this discussion we will use 365 days. On January 1 of each year, the physical location of Earth with respect to the Sun is nearly the same, except for leap years, when the lag introduced by the extra \( \frac{1}{4} \) day of orbiting time is built into the calendar. We call January 1 ``day 1'' of the year. Then, for example, day 31 is January 31, day 59 is February 28, and so on.
        \bigbreak \noindent 
        The number of the day in a year can be considered a variable that determines Earth’s position in its orbit. As Earth revolves around the Sun, its physical location changes relative to the Sun. After one full year, we are back where we started, and a new year begins. According to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, the shape of the orbit is elliptical, with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse1.

        Figure 1 depicts Earth’s orbit around the Sun during one year. The point labeled \( F_2 \) is one of the foci of the ellipse; the other focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs to each point on the ellipse (Figure 2). Then each \( x \) value on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and each \( y \) value is also a value of position as a function of time. Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value of Earth’s position as a function of time.

    \begin{dfn}
        If \( x \) and \( y \) are continuous functions of \( t \) on an interval \( I \), then the equations
        \[ x = x(t) \quad \text{and} \quad y = y(t) \]
        are called \textbf{parametric equations} and \( t \) is called the \textbf{parameter}. The set of points \( (x, y) \) obtained as \( t \) varies over the interval \( I \) is called the graph of the parametric equations. The graph of parametric equations is called a \textbf{parametric curve} or plane curve, and is denoted by \( C \).
    \end{dfn}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \nt{Notice in this definition that \( x \) and \( y \) are used in two ways. The first is as functions of the independent variable \( t \). As \( t \) varies over the interval \( I \), the functions \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \) generate a set of ordered pairs \( (x, y) \). This set of ordered pairs generates the graph of the parametric equations. In this second usage, to designate the ordered pairs, \( x \) and \( y \) are variables. It is important to distinguish the variables \( x \) and \( y \) from the functions \( x(t) \) and \( y(t) \).}

        The second and third columns in this table provide a set of points to be plotted. The graph of these points appears in Figure 3. The arrows on the graph indicate the orientation of the graph, that is, the direction that a point moves on the graph as t varies from −3 to 2.

    \subsubsection{Eliminating the Parameter}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    To better understand the graph of a curve represented parametrically, it is useful to rewrite the two equations as a single equation relating the variables \( x \) and \( y \). Then we can apply any previous knowledge of equations of curves in the plane to identify the curve. For example, the equations describing the plane curve in Example 1.1b. are
    \[
        x(t) = t^2 - 3, \quad y(t) = 2t + 1, \quad -2 \leq t \leq 3.
    \]
    Solving the second equation for \( t \) gives
    \[
        t = \frac{y - 1}{2}.
    \]
    This can be substituted into the first equation:
    \begin{align*}
        &x = \left(\frac{y-1}{2}\right)^{2} - 3 \\
        &x = \frac{(y-1)^{2}}{4} - 3 \\
        &x = \frac{y^{2}-2y+1}{4}-3 \\
        &x = \frac{y^{2}-2y-11}{4}
    .\end{align*}
    This equation describes \( x \) as a function of \( y \). These steps give an example of \textit{eliminating the parameter}. The graph of this function is a parabola opening to the right. Recall that the plane curve started at \( (1, -3) \) and ended at \( (6, 7) \). These terminations were due to the restriction on the parameter \( t \).
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Sometimes it is necessary to be a bit creative in eliminating the parameter. The parametric equations for this example are
    \begin{align*}
        x(t) = 4\cos{t}, \quad y(t) = 3\sin{t}
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Solving either equation for $t$ directly is not advisable because sine and cosine are not one-to-one functions. However, dividing the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 (and suppressing the $t$) gives us
    \begin{align*}
        \cos{t} = \frac{x}{4}, \quad \sin{t} = \frac{y}{3}
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Now use the Pythagorean identity  $\cos^{2}{t} + \sin^{2}{t} = 1$ and replace the expressions for $\sin{t}$ and $\cos{t}$ with the equivalent expressions in terms of $x$ and $y$. This gives
    \begin{align*}
        &\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^{2} +  \left(\frac{y}{3}\right)^{2} = 1 \\
        &\frac{x^{2}}{16}  + \frac{y^{2}}{9} = 1
    .\end{align*}
    \pagebreak \bigbreak \noindent 
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.47\textwidth}
        This is the equation of a horizontal ellipse centered at the origin, with semimajor axis 4 and semiminor axis 3 as shown in the following graph. 
    \end{minipage}
    \hspace{.1in}
    \begin{minipage}[]{0.47\textwidth}
        \fig{.8}{./figures/6.jpeg} 
    \end{minipage}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    So far we have seen the method of eliminating the parameter, assuming we know a set of parametric equations that describe a plane curve. What if we would like to start with the equation of a curve and determine a pair of parametric equations for that curve? This is certainly possible, and in fact it is possible to do so in many different ways for a given curve. The process is known as \textbf{parameterization of a curve}.
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \begin{exm}[Parameterizing a Curve]
        Find two different pairs of parametric equations to represent the graph of  $y=2x^{2}-3.$
    \end{exm}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \textcolor{red}{\textit{Solution.}}
    First, it is always possible to parameterize a curve by defining \( x(t) = t \), then replacing \( x \) with \( t \) in the equation for \( y(t) \). This gives the parameterization
    \[
        x(t) = t, \quad y(t) = 2t^2 - 3.
    \]
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    We have complete freedom in the choice for the second parameterization. For example, we can choose \( x(t) = 3t - 2 \). The only thing we need to check is that there are no restrictions imposed on \( x \); that is, the range of \( x(t) \) is all real numbers. This is the case for \( x(t) = 3t - 2 \). Now since \( y = 2x^2 - 3 \), we can substitute \( x(t) = 3t - 2 \) for \( x \). This gives
    \begin{align*}
        &y(t) = 2(3t - 2)^2 - 3 \\
        &= 2(9t^2 - 12t + 4) - 3 \\
        &= 18t^2 - 24t + 8 - 3 \\
        &= 18t^2 - 24t + 5
    .\end{align*}
    Therefore, a second parameterization of the curve can be written as
    \[
        x(t) = 3t - 2 \quad \text{and} \quad y(t) = 18t^2 - 24t + 5.
    \]

    \subsubsection{Cycloids and Other Parametric Curves}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Imagine going on a bicycle ride through the country. The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable pattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side of the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a \textbf{cycloid} (Figure 7). A cycloid generated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations
    \begin{align*}
        x(t) = a(t-\sin{t})
        x(t)=a(t−sint),y(t)=a(1−cost).
    .\end{align*}
