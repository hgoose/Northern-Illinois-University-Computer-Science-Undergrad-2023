        \hspace{\parindent} This study aims to determine the acceleration due to gravity ($g$) by analyzing a cart's motion down an inclined track at three different angles. Using a motion detector and LoggerPro software, the data for the position and velocity were collected for nine trials (three per angle). Data analysis for this lab involves creating scatter plots and trendlines to compute experimental values for $g$. The results are then compared to the accepted $g$ value (9.81 $m/s^{2}$) to evaluate the experiment's accuracy through percent error calculations.

    \section{Theory}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    From our everyday observations, we know that a ball will accelerate downhill if nothing stops it. Now, we aim to quantify this acceleration. To start, we must determine the slope of the incline by measuring its height at two points, $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$, set apart by a distance, $\ell$. Referring to Figure \thefigtitle, these measurements help us identify two smaller triangles within a larger one, sharing the same angle, $\theta$, with the horizontal. Using basic trigonometry, we can calculate this angle from our measurement
    \begin{equation}
        \tan{\left(\theta\right)}  &= \frac{\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}} = \frac{h_{2}-h_{1}}{\ell} \\
       \implies \theta  = \tan^{-1}{\left(\frac{h_{2}-h_{1}}{\ell}\right)}
    \end{equation}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    This measurement then enables us to correlate the acceleration we observe with g, the gravitational acceleration value.
    \bigbreak \noindent

    \fc{Shows the similarity between the smaller and larger triangle, as well as labeling the measurements required for finding the angle $\theta$}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \begin{remark}
        We have the flexibility to set up our coordinate systems in a manner that simplifies describing the ball's motion, positioning the x-direction parallel to the incline does just this (Figure \thefigtitle). We can then consider the kinematic equations for position and velocity.
        \begin{align*}
            v(t) &= v_{0} + at \\
            x(t) &= x_{0} + v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2}at^{2}
        .\end{align*}
    \end{remark}
    \pagebreak \bigbreak \noindent 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \incfig{fig2}
        \label{fig:fig2}
    \end{figure}
    \fc{Shows how we define our coordinate access}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Given the ability to define our coordinate system in such a way to aid in our computations, we set the ball's starting position at $x=0$. With the ball beginning from a stationary state, its initial velocity, $v_{0}$, is also zero. Consequently, this simplification leads to the equation
    \begin{equation}
        v(t) = at
    \end{equation}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Next, we account for gravity acting directly downwards, at an angle to the plane. The component of gravity along the x-axis is responsible for the acceleration down the plane, which we define within our coordinate system as (figure \thefigtitle)
    \begin{equation}
       a=g\sin{\left(\theta\right)} 
    \end{equation}
    \bigbreak \noindent
    \begin{figure}[ht]
        \centering
        \incfig{figab}
        \label{fig:figab}
    \end{figure}
    \fc{Shows the relationship between $g$ and $g_{x}$, as defined by our coordinate axis}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    We now substitude this value for a into equation 2.
    \begin{equation}
       v(t) = g\sin{\left(\theta \right)}t
    \end{equation}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    When conducting measurements of position and velocity during the experiment, plotting the data should reveal a linear relationship between velocity and time, akin to the standard linear equation \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) represents the slope of the line. By analogy, with \(y = mx + b\), \(t\) serves as our independent variable, making the slope (\(m\)) proportional to \(g\) through the relationship
    \begin{equation}
        m = g \sin(\theta) \Rightarrow g = \frac{m}{\sin(\theta)} 
    \end{equation}
    We can then evaluate our experimental \(g\) value against the accepted value of \(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\) by calculating the percent error as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        \%Error = \left| \frac{\text{Accepted} - \text{Measured}}{\text{Accepted}} \right| \times 100\%
    \end{equation}

    \begin{align*}
        g &= \frac{m}{\sin{\left(\theta\right)}} = \frac{1.18}{\sin{\left(7.6^{\circ}\right)}} \\
         &=8.92 m/s^{2}

    \begin{align*}
        \text{Percent Error } &= \bigg\lvert \frac{9.8 m/s^{2} - 8.92 m/s^{2}}{9.8 m/s^{2}} \bigg\rvert \times 100\% \\

    \section{Discussion}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    In our endeavor to measure the acceleration due to gravity, the experiment yielded a spectrum of results, illustrating both the challenges and intricacies of physical measurements. Our findings, while aligning with the expected value of 9.81 $m/s^{2}$ 
  in some trials, diverged significantly in others, with percent errors ranging from a minimal 2.04\% to a substantial 88.57\%. This variance prompts a reflection on the potential sources of discrepancy and the lessons learned for future experimental design.

The precision in measuring the incline's angle emerged as a critical factor. Minor inaccuracies in this measurement could lead to significant deviations in the calculated value of 
$g$, underscoring the importance of measurement accuracy in experimental physics. Additionally, the assumption of zero initial velocity, though theoretically sound, proved challenging to ensure in practice, potentially skewing our velocity and position data.

Friction and air resistance also played undeniable roles in our experiment, despite their exclusion from our theoretical model. These forces, inherent in any real-world scenario, undoubtedly influenced our measurements, suggesting a need for their consideration in future analyses.

The use of motion detectors and LoggerPro software, while facilitating data collection, introduced its own set of variables. The potential for equipment sensitivity and calibration errors highlighted the importance of understanding and mitigating technological limitations.

To enhance the accuracy of future experiments, several strategies are recommended. Employing more precise instruments for angle measurement, such as digital protractors, could reduce systematic errors. Acknowledging and attempting to quantify the effects of friction and air resistance would align our theoretical model more closely with practical conditions. Moreover, increasing the number of trials and employing statistical methods to analyze the data could help mitigate random errors and provide a more robust estimate of $g$.

Reflecting on this experiment, it becomes evident that the pursuit of precision in physics is as much about understanding and adapting to the limitations of our methods as it is about the phenomena we aim to measure. By critically analyzing our approach and results, we gain not only insights into the specific parameters of our study but also valuable lessons on the nature of scientific inquiry itself.
