        1. The three most popular options on a certain type of new car at a dealership are a built-in GPS (A), a sunroof (B), and an automatic transmission (C). Suppose that \(P(A) = 0.40\), \(P(B) = 0.55\), \(P(C) = 0.70\), \(P(A \cup B) = 0.63\), and \(P(B \cap C) = 0.45\). Suppose that a customer at the dealership is selected at random.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)] Find the probability that the customer wants a sunroof given that they want an automatic transmission.
            \item[(b)] As you walk around the dealershipâ€™s lot, you see a customer drive away in the car they just bought. You clearly see that their car has a sunroof. What is the probability that their car has a built-in GPS?

    \begin{remark}
        For any two events \( A \) and \( B \), the conditional probability of \( A \)
        given that \( B \) has occurred is defined by
        \[
            P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
        \]

    a.)
    \begin{align*}
        P(B \mid C) &= \frac{P(B \cap C)}{P(C)} \\
        &= \frac{0.45}{0.70} = 0.6429 \\
        &\approx 64\%
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.)  First we need to find $P(A\cap B) $
    \begin{align*}
        P(A\cup B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B) \\
        \implies P(A\cap B) &= P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cup B) \\
        \therefore P(A\cap B) &= 0.4 + 0.55 - 0.63 \\
                              &=0.32
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    From here, we can compute $P(A\mid B) $
    \begin{align*}
        P(A \mid B) &= \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \\
                    &=\frac{0.32}{0.55} =0.5818 \\

        2. A department store sells sport shirts in three sizes (small, medium, and large), three patterns (plaid, print, and stripe), and two sleeve lengths (long and short). The table below gives the proportions of shirts sold in the various category combinations.

    a.) According to the table of proportions, we see the probability of the next sold shirt being medium, short-sleeved, and striped is $0.12 = 12\% $
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.) The probability that the next sold shirt is large is the sum of the proportions of the large shirts
    \begin{align*}
        \therefore P(\text{large } \cap \text{ print}) &= 0.07 + 0.02 \\
        &=0.09 = 9\%

    \bigbreak \noindent 
    c.) Similar to part b, we find
    \begin{align*}
        P(\text{small}) &= 0.04 + 0.02 + 0.05 + 0.03 + 0.02 + 0.03 \\
                        &=0.19 = 19\%
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    d.) Looking at the given table, we find
    \begin{align*}
        P(\text{Long-sleeved } \cap \text{ Plaid}) &= 0.03 + 0.1 + 0.04 \\
        &=0.17 = 17\%

        3. Suppose an individual is randomly selected from the population of all adult males living in the United States. Let \(A\) be the event that the selected individual is over 6 feet in height, and let \(B\) be the event that the selected individual is a professional basketball player. Which do you think is larger, \(P(A|B)\) or \(P(B|A)\)? Why?
    \end{mdframed}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    The probability that the individual is over 6 feet in height, given they are a professional basketball player $(P(A \mid B))$ would likely be larger than the probability of the individual being a professional basketball, given they are over 6 feet in height $(P(B \mid A))$. This is due to the fact that in the first case $P(B)$, (the smaller probability), would be in the denominator, which yields a greater number in contrast to $P(A)$, (the larger probability) being in the denominator.
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    It also makes sense logically. Most professional basketball players are very tall, whereas most tall people are not basketball players.

        4. At a certain gas station, 50\% of the customers purchase regular gas, 30\% purchase plus gas, and 20\% purchase premium gas. Of those customers purchasing regular gas, 40\% fill their tanks. Of those customers purchasing plus gas, 50\% fill their tanks, whereas of those purchasing premium gas, 60\% fill their tanks. Suppose that a customer at the gas station is selected at random.

Then for any other event \( B \) for which \( P(B) > 0 \), the posterior probability of \( A_j \) given that \( B \) has occurred is

    To solve 4, first we define some notation. Let $A_{i} = \{\text{ Gas type $i$ }\}$, for $i\in \{1,2,3\}$, $B = \{ \text{Fills tank}\}$, and $B^{\prime} = \{\text{Does not fill tank}\} $
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    From the given information, we have $P(A_{1}) = 0.5$, $P(A_{2}) = 0.3$, $P(A_{3}) = 0.2$, $P(B \mid A_{1}) = 0.4$, $P(B \mid A_{2}) = 0.5$, and $P(B \mid A_{3}) = 0.6 $

    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.)  From the law of total probability, we have
    \begin{align*}
        P(B) &= \summation{k}{i=1}\ P(B\mid A_{i}) \cdot P(A_{i})\ \\
        \implies P(B) &= (0.4 \cdot 0.5) + (0.3 \cdot 0.5) + (0.6 \cdot 0.2) \\

        5. In a particular college statistics course, twenty percent of the students had previously taken a statistics course during high school while the others had not. Among those students who had taken a high school course, twenty-five percent received an A in their college course; while only fifteen percent of those students with no prior exposure received an A in the college course. Suppose that one student from the college course is selected at random.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[(a)] Find the probability that they had taken statistics during high school and receive an A in their college course.
            \item[(b)] Find the probability that they receive an A in the college course.
            \item[(c)] Suppose that you overhear the student boasting about receiving an A in their college statistics course. Find the probability that they had not taken a statistics course during high school.
        \end{itemize}

    First, we define some notation. Let $A = \{ \text{Taken statistics in high school} \}$,  \\
    $A^{\prime} =\{ \text{No high school stats course} \} $, and $B = \{ \text{Recieved A in college course} \} $

    We have $P(A) = 0.2 $, $P(A^{\prime})  = 0.8$, $P(B \mid A) = 0.25 $, and $P(B \mid A^{\prime}) = 0.15$
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    a.) From the information above, we find
    \begin{align*}
        P(A \cap B) &= P(B\mid A) \cdot P(A) \\
        &=0.25(0.2) = 0.05 = 5\%
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.) Using the law of total probability, we see
    \begin{align*}
        P(B) &= \summation{k}{i=1}\ P(B\mid A_{i})P(A_{i})\ \\
        &= (0.25 \cdot 0.2) + (0.15 \cdot 0.8) \\
        &=0.17 = 17\%

    \bigbreak \noindent 
    c.)  Now using Bayes' theorem, we find
    \begin{align*}
        P(A^{\prime} \mid B) &= \frac{P(B\mid A^{\prime}) \cdot P(A^{\prime})}{P(B)} \\
        &=\frac{0.15 \cdot 0.8}{0.17} \\

    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.) The probability that one selection is not AB is $1-P(AB) = 1-0.04 = 0.6 $. Thus, the probability that two selections are not AB is given by

        0.96^{2} = 0.9216 \approx 92\%

The probability that at least one selection is type O is the complement of the probability that no selection is type O. Thus,

    \begin{align*}
        P(\text{All three failing}) &= P(\text{one failing})^{3} \\
        &=0.2^{3} = 0.008 = .8\%
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    b.) Without using the binomial formula, we will have to do this one manually by finding the union of the scenarios. We have three different scenarios ($3P1 = \frac{3 \cdot 2!}{2!} = 3$). 
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Scenario 1} &= P(\text{fail} \cap \text{pass} \cap \text{pass}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.8^{2}  = 0.128\\
        \text{Scenario 2} &= P(\text{pass} \cap \text{fail} \cap \text{pass}) =0.8 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.8 = 0.128\\
        \text{Scenario 3} &= P(\text{pass} \cap \text{pass} \cap \text{fail})  = 0.8 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.128
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    Thus, 
    \begin{align*}
        P(\text{Exactly one fails}) &= P(\text{Scenario 1} \cup \text{Scenario 2} \cup \text{Scenario 3}) \\
        &= 3(0.128) = 0.384 \approx 38\%
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    \textbf{Note:} All three scenarios are disjoint so we don't subtract the intersection.
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    c.) The probability that at least one fails is the complement of the probability that none fail
    \begin{align*}
        1-P(\text{None fail})  &= 1-0.8^{3} \\
       &=0.488
    .\end{align*}
    \bigbreak \noindent 
    d.) The probability that at most one fail is given by
    \begin{align*}
        P(\text{none fail} \cup \text{one fail}) &= P(\text{none fail}) + P(\text{one fail}) \\
        &=0.8^{3} + 0.384 \\
        &=0.896 \approx 90\%
    .\end{align*}
