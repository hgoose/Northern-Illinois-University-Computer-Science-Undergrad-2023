In navigation, the heading of a vessel or aircraft is the compass direction
in which the craft's bow or nose is pointed. Note that the heading may not
#necessarily be the direction that the vehicle actually travels, which is
known as its course or track. Any difference between the heading and
course is due to the motion of the underlying medium, the air or water,
or other effects like skidding or slipping. The difference is known as
the drift, and can be determined by the wind triangle. At least seven ways
to measure the heading of a vehicle have been described. A compass installed
in a vehicle or vessel has a certain amount of error caused by the magnetic 
properties of the vessel. This error is known as compass deviation. The 
magnitude of the compass deviation varies greatly depending upon the local 
anomalies created by the vessel. A fiberglass recreational vessel will 
#generally have much less compass deviation than a steel-hulled vessel. 
Electrical wires carrying current have a small magnetic field around them 
and can cause deviation. Any type of magnet, such as found in a speaker 
can also cause large magnitudes of compass deviation. The error can be 
corrected using a deviation table. Deviation tables are very difficult to 
create. Once a deviation table is established, it is only good for that 
particular vessel, with that particular configuration. If electrical wires 
are moved or anything else magnetic (speakers, electric motors, etc.) are 
moved, the deviation table will change. All deviations in the deviation 
table are indicated west or east. If the compass is pointing west of the 
Magnetic North Pole, then the deviation is westward. If the compass is 
pointing east of the Magnetic North Pole, then the deviation is eastward.
