    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Requirements engineering is the process of developing a software specification.} : True
        \item \textbf{One approach to reducing the costs of rework is "change anticipation", where the process is designed so that changes can be accommodated at relatively low cost.}: False
        \item \textbf{Programming is an individual activity with no standard process.}: True
        \item \textbf{It is increasingly irrelevant to distinguish between software development and evolution.}: true
        \item \textbf{Process descriptions may include pre- and post-conditions, which are statements that are true before and after a process activity has been enacted or a product produced.}: True
        \item \textbf{An advantage of the waterfall model is the ease of accommodating change after the process is underway.}: False
        \item \textbf{Agile processes are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.}: False
        \item \textbf{Component adaptation and integration is a key stage of which software process model ?}: Integration and configuration
        \item \textbf{Which of the following is not a stage of testing?}: Value testing
        \item \textbf{In the SEI Capability Maturity Model which level denotes that process improvement strategies have been defined and are being used ?}: Optimized
